Thanks for the consideration! A few notes from me:

  - Font match: I'm using Inter like on the Figma design file, but it's not a perfect match for kerning. Therefore some of the sets of buttons are not pixel-perfect. I'd normally ask the designer about this to see if they have a font file for me.
  - I have some fake functions in the lib/utils.ts file, as well as the hard-coded data
  - The shape of the data I assumed can be found in the types/types.d.ts file
  - I'm eager for your feedback!

Best,  
Jenny
